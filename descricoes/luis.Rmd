### Description

I obtained a Ph.D. and a Master in Statistics at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), with a thesis about “COWORDS: A Probabilistic Model for Text Visualization” and “New tools for visualization of georeferenced data: an integration between R and Google Maps.” I worked in the private sector as a data scientist for marketing and as Research Fellow at the University of Minas Gerais on health and social statistics. During my assignments, I implemented various statistical projects ranging from the development of predictive models in a Hadoop environment to pattern detection on health data using machine learning techniques. In 2013, my master thesis received the award Prêmio de Incentivo em Ciência e Tecnologia para o SUS (Science and technology incentive award for the Brazilian Unified Health System)
